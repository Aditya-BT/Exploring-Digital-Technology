In this seventh week, we had an intresting guest lecture on the Building Blocks of Automation. In this lecture we understood about what the core operations are that need to take place for us to automate a process. 
A simple set up of such a machine would need to have a system with a sensor that can detect the necessary change and turn itself on or off according to the feedback it receives, to explain the same the  instructor 
used the idea of an AC turning on or off depending on the surrounding temperature it senses. We also learned about a few applications and the usefullness of automation.
