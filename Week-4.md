#Week 4
In our fourth week we started by downloading the Ubuntu shell, here we learnt that a shell allows us to in a way, directly communicate with our machine i.e. our laptops. Initially, we did have difficulties starting up the ubuntu shell but once we did we started off by using basic commands such as the - mkdir command and cd command, which allowed us to make and change directories into which we could inturn save files. We also learnt to make shortcuts to applications, in the sense that the shortcut would allow us to open the application using the shell directly just by entering the required name.
